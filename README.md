# Adventure Works Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze various aspects of the AdventureWorks dataset, focusing on employee, supplier, manufacturing, customer, and sales analyses. Using SQLAlchemy and Python, the data was extracted, transformed, and analyzed to provide actionable insights into different business areas.

## Files
- **Adventure Works Analysis (SQLAlchemy).ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook containing SQL queries and analyses performed on the AdventureWorks dataset using SQLAlchemy. The notebook covers key analyses, including employee, supplier, manufacturing, and sales data.
- **Rapport.pdf**: A comprehensive report detailing the analysis, including SQL query logic, findings, and recommendations. The report is structured to present key insights derived from employee distribution, supplier performance, production efficiency, customer density, and sales performance.

## Key Analyses
1. **Employee Analysis**:
   - Examines employee distribution across departments, highlighting the focus on production, the potential need for recruitment, and efficiency improvements in key areas.
   
2. **Supplier Analysis**:
   - Analyzes supplier performance, focusing on total sales and average order size, with recommendations for future contract negotiations.

3. **Manufacturing Analysis**:
   - Investigates product demand and production efficiency, identifying the most requested products and offering suggestions for improving production processes.

4. **Customer and Sales Analysis**:
   - Provides insights into customer distribution across cities and correlates customer density with sales performance, revealing the need for customized marketing strategies.

5. **Sales Category Analysis**:
   - Focuses on the most profitable product categories, with an emphasis on bicycles as the core product and clothing as a high-volume but lower-revenue category.

6. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Includes a confidence interval analysis of the average sales price of bicycles, providing a statistical foundation for future pricing decisions.

## How to Use
1. **Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Open the `.ipynb` file in a Jupyter environment.
   - Execute the cells to reproduce the analysis or modify them for further exploration.
  
2. **PDF Report**:
   - Review the detailed findings in `Rapport.pdf`, which offers a structured overview of the analysis, conclusions, and strategic recommendations.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **SQLAlchemy**: A SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for interacting with the AdventureWorks database.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: To run and visualize the analyses.
